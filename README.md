This repository contains the code and resources for a Churn Analysis and Prediction project. The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior data to identify factors leading to customer churn and build predictive models that help businesses retain at-risk customers.

Project Overview
Customer churn refers to the loss of customers over time, which can significantly impact a business. This project leverages data science and machine learning techniques to predict churn by analyzing historical customer data.

Features of the Project
i  Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and scaling customer data for optimal model performance.
ii Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding key patterns and factors contributing to churn using visualization and statistical analysis.
iii Feature Engineering: Creating new features that enhance model performance.
iv Model Building: Developing machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for churn prediction.
v Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
vi Customer Segmentation: Segmenting customers based on their likelihood to churn for targeted interventions.

Tech Stack
i Languages: Python
ii Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost
iii Tools: Jupyter Notebook

Results
i The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test dataset.
 i Customer segments with the highest churn probability were identified for business action.
